# Snake Game using Python and Turtle Graphics

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and the Turtle graphics library. The game allows players to control a snake that grows in length as it consumes food while avoiding collisions with the screen borders and its own body.

## Features

- The Snake game is built using Python and the Turtle graphics library, making it a great example for beginners to understand basic game development concepts.
- The snake's movement is controlled using arrow keys, and the game supports a "stop" action using the spacebar.
- The snake grows longer as it consumes food, and the player's score increases with each successful consumption.
- The game tracks the player's highest score throughout their gameplay.
- The graphical interface of the game window is created using Turtle, making it interactive and visually appealing.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the Python script (`snake_game.py`) using a Python interpreter.
3. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement: up, down, left, and right.
4. Press the spacebar to stop the snake's movement.
5. The objective is to consume food and grow the snake's length while avoiding collisions with the screen borders and its own body.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle graphics library (usually included with Python)

## Credits

This project is created by Aditya Shandilya and is inspired by various Snake game implementations available online.
